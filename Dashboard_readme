# Canola Price Prediction Dashboard - README

This repository contains a **Canola Price Prediction Dashboard** created using **Sigma Computing**. The dashboard provides insights into canola price trends, production data, and the relationship between canola prices and inflation. It also includes a comparison of **actual** and **predicted** canola prices using the **XGBoost** machine learning model.

---

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of the following key components:

1. **Canola Price Monthly Comparison**:
   - Displays the monthly canola price and the percentage change compared to the previous month (e.g., 3.1% increase in January 2020 vs December 2019).

2. **Production Monthly Comparison**:
   - Shows the monthly production volume and the percentage change compared to the previous month (e.g., 8.8% increase in January 2020 vs December 2019).

3. **CMAx Canola Price**:
   - Highlights the maximum canola price observed (e.g., 509 USD/ton) and the average price (e.g., 456 USD/ton).

4. **Actual and Predicted Canola Price Using XGBoost**:
   - A **line chart** comparing the actual canola prices with the predicted prices generated by the XGBoost model over time (from 2015 to 2019).

5. **Canola Monthly Average Price Relation with Inflation**:
   - A **line chart** showing the relationship between the monthly average canola price and **scaled inflation rates** (inflation multiplied by 100 to convert to percentages) over time.

## Steps to Create the Dashboard in Sigma Computing

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Convert Year and Month to Date Column**:
     - Combined the `Year` and `Month` columns into a single `Date` column using the formula:
       ```plaintext
       Text([Year]) & "-" & Text([Month]) & "-01"
       ```
     - Converted the resulting string into a **date format** for time-series analysis.

   - **Scale Inflation Data**:
     - Multiplied the inflation values by 100 to convert them from decimals (e.g., 0.025) to percentages (e.g., 2.5%).
     - Formula used:
       ```plaintext
       [Inflation] * 100
       ```

### 2. **KPIs and Metrics**
   - Created **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for:
     - Monthly canola price change (e.g., 3.1% increase in January 2020 vs December 2019).
     - Monthly production volume change (e.g., 8.8% increase in January 2020 vs December 2019).
     - Maximum, average, and minimum canola prices.

### 3. **Visualizations**
   - **Line Chart for Actual vs Predicted Prices**:
     - Plotted the **actual** and **predicted** canola prices on the same line chart using different colors (e.g., blue for actual, orange for predicted).
     - Added tooltips and markers to highlight specific data points.
   - **Line Chart for Canola Price and Scaled Inflation**:
     - Plotted the monthly average canola price and **scaled inflation rates** (inflation multiplied by 100) on the same chart to visualize their relationship.

### 4. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Organized the KPIs and visualizations into a clean and intuitive layout.
   - Used **filters** and **interactive elements** to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
